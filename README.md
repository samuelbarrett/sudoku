# sudoku
A Sudoku game with a solving algorithm. To be developed into a webapp so I can further my front-end skills.

My immediate goals for this project are to have a functioning game of Sudoku, experiment with different solving algorithms and data structures,
  and develop a front-end for the project.
 
Some further exploration into this project may yield variable board sizes and shapes, but I'm sticking to the basics for now as I'm having the most fun
  playing with the solving algorithms for standard Sudoku puzzles.
